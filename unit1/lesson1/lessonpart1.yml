  ## Introduction to SVG


  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language and file format for creating
  two-dimensional vector graphics. SVG is widely used for web graphics because
  it is scalable, meaning it can be resized without losing quality. In this
  lesson, we'll start by creating a simple rectangle using SVG in an HTML page.


  ### Example: Creating a Rectangle with SVG


  Below is an example of a basic HTML page that includes an SVG rectangle. This
  example will help you understand how SVG elements are embedded within HTML.


  ```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html><head>
      <title>SVG Rectangle Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="100" height="100" x="50" y="50" fill="blue" />
      </svg>
  </body>

  </html>

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **SVG Element**: The `<svg>` tag defines the SVG container. The `width` and
  `height` attributes set the size of the SVG canvas.


  * **Rectangle Element**: The `<rect>` tag is used to draw a rectangle. The
  `width` and `height` attributes specify the size of the rectangle. The `x` and
  `y` attributes position the rectangle within the SVG canvas. The `fill`
  attribute sets the color of the rectangle.


  * SVG is a kind of XML language. That means we have opening and closing tags
  like HTML. The main **element** is **svg**. Inside that **element tag**, we
  have a **rect** element. We can add more elements; each element will represent
  a different shape or curve or line. We have a few **attributes** inside the
  rect tag. The syntax for 


  ### Try It Yourself


  Copy the code above into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the
  rectangle. Experiment by changing the rectangle's size, position, and color to
  see how it affects the display.


  In the next lesson, we'll explore more complex SVG shapes and attributes.
  Happy coding!
